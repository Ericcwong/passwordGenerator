This project is for a user who wants to randomly generate a password to use on whatever requires a password. The user has options to choose from lower case, upper case, numbers, and or special characters. There are requirements that is the user must choose in order to make the code work. One of the options must be chosen and the password can not be less than eight or higher than 128. Once all requirements have been met, a password will be generated. If the user doesn't approve of the generated password, they have the option to click the generate button as many time as they desire till that perfect is generated. When satisfied with the password they can copy it to their clipboard by clicking on the "clip to clipboard" button.
